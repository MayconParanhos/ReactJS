# Mortgage Calculator 

This litle project was built following the "Learn React by Building a Mortgage Calculator" tutorial, authored by Joy Shaheb.

## Why?

To really master Reactjs we need to practice as mach as possible. Also, there are several libraries to include in our projects, so we need to know how they work by practising.

### I want to follow the same tutorial.
